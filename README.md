# League of Legends World Championship Finals Website (ID Assignment 1)

An informative website for League of Legends (LOL) fans to receive latest updates for the LOL World Championship Finals (LOLWC) and all other LOL-related content. 

Through this website, Riot Games (developer of LOL) can hype fans up for the big day and increase conversion rate of visitors into summoners (Riot Games' way of calling their avid LOL gamers).
 
## Design Process

This website was first ideated and visualised using a high-fidelity wireframe, and then coded from scratch using HTML, CSS and Javascript. As a LOL fan myself, I thought it would be great for me to visit a consolidated and comprehensive website to learn about all the LOLWC-related information I wish to learn about without having to scroll through thousands of social media accounts with information all over the place. It is a bonus if I can interact with certain elements on the website to have a greater sense of community and participation in LOLWC.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

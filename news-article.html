                <p class="publication-info">21 OCTOBER 2021 - BY PCS</p>
                <p>The pinnacle moment for the eventual Worlds 2021 Championship team just got even bigger! With our global partner 
                Mercedes-Benz, we are unveiling the design for special championship rings that will be awarded to each member of the 
                Worlds 2021 Championship team.<br><br>
                
                These specially-designed rings, co-created by our brand and event design team and Mercedes-Benz exterior designers, 
                will be a new keepsake to the winning team, joining the prized Summoner’s Cup during the Trophy Ceremony presented 
                by Mercedes-Benz.<br><br>
                
                Each team member will receive a personalized championship ring designed specifically for the 2021 Champions with the 
                year, player’s summoner name and team tricode all displayed on the custom fitted piece. The ring will reflect the iconic 
                blue and silver color palette of the Summoner’s Cup, with distinct features and markings unique to the 2021 LoL Esports 
                season.<br><br></p>

                <p>“Championship rings are a storied tradition in sports, synonymous with the highest achievements and unmatched excellence,” 
                    said Naz Aletaha, Riot Games Global Head of League of Legends Esports. “Since the start of our partnership in 2020, 
                    Mercedes-Benz has helped elevate and celebrate the best-of-the best in LoL Esports, and we are thrilled to bring together our 
                    shared love for design and innovation to make a resounding mark on the crowning achievement of our sport.”<br><br>
                    
                    “The Championship Ring is an elegant and timeless masterpiece created by Mercedes-EQ and Riot Games,” says Bettina Fetzer, 
                    Head of Communications and Marketing Mercedes-Benz AG. “A ring that honors the best of the best and thus underscores our 
                    brand’s claim to leadership in the constant reinterpretation of luxury.”<br><br>
                    
                    Handmade by GOOD ART HLYWD in Los Angeles, each ring is created from 18 karat white gold, with a custom cut sapphire 
                    jewel and a real diamond encased in the hands of the iconic Summoner.<br><br>
                    
                    Prior to the 2021 World Final, Mercedes-Benz and Riot Games will provide exclusive insights into the creation process of the 
                    Championship Ring in a short form documentary that will be available on the official League of Legends Esports YouTube 
                    channel.<br><br>
